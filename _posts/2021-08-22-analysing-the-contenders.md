The upcoming 2021-22 NBA Season is upon us, and it is prime time to analyze the top teams in the NBA, now that all the major Free Agency moves have been made. A potential blockbuster trade `(read: Ben Simmons)` could throw a spanner in the works in so far as this blog, but its unlikeliness presents a good opportunity to go through the teams and attempt to find how the potential contenders and their rosters look ahead of this exciting season. Let's dive in!

The Brooklyn Nets, are _(rather obviously)_ primed to make another run at the Larry O'Brien Trophy for the 2021-22 season. They have a fully stacked roster with 3 All-NBA level players in Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant and James Harden. To supplement a trio that unfair should usually be constricted by the salary cap rules, but GM Sean Marks has struck all the right deals to round out this roster. The moves can be ranked in importance as follows:
- Retaining Blake Griffin (that too on a minimum deal!)
- Bringing quality backup at Point Guard with the Patty Mills acquisition
- Bringing quality spot minutes role players in Bruce Brown Jr. and James Johnson.

The Nets also overperformed in the draft with promising 19-year old guard Cam Thomas, who was just named Summer League Co-MVP and raw and young big man, Day'Ron Sharpe.

#### Off-Season Grade: A+

#### Potential Weaknesses:
- <b>Health</b>: It is general consensus that the 2020 NBA Championship Trophy would have landed in Brooklyn if not for injuries to core players James Harden and Kyrie Irving.
- <b>Interior Defense</b>: The Eastern Conference final showed that Giannis, Lopez and Portis were able to capitalize on the relatively weak interior defense for the Nets.<br/>This could be the challenge to the Nets coaching staff, which if accomplished, would take this team from `unfair` to `completely unfair`. Although this could just be nitpicking as the Nets offense could more than cover this up as is.

The defending champions, Milwaukee Bucks are looking to retain the Larry O'Brien Trophy for the 2021-22 season. They have made some decent moves in retaining some and shuffling some role players, which may not move the needle too much, but they are sitting pretty at the moment with their championship core of Giannis, Jrue and Middleton. Their moves can be ranked in impact as follows:
- Bringing back Bobby Portis on a team friendly deal
- Replacing Bryn Forbes with a tenacious impact player in Grayson Allen
- Bringing vets in George Hill and Rodney Hood

They will also be getting back another impact player they missed last playoffs in Donte DiVincenzo who brings in a quality 3&D ballhandling presence. He can fill that spot in the absence of and slot alongside Jrue Holiday like he did in their 2021 campaign before getting injured.
Young sharpshooting forward Jordan Nwora also had strong Olympics and Summer League showings which could lead to him breaking into the rotation during the regular season.

The Bucks offense, in the last regular season, ranked in the top 5 in every offense-related advanced stat (ORTG, EFG%, TS% etc.). With not many changes coming to the offensive side of things, one can expect that performance to repeat coming into the new regular season with Finals MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo leading the way along with his co-stars Jrue Holiday and Khris Middleton. It will be very interesting to see how they elevate their game further.

#### Off-Season Grade: B+

#### Potential Weaknesses:
- <b>Perimeter Defense</b>: The Bucks lost a valuable perimeter defender in vaunted veteran PJ Tucker to their Eastern Conference competitors in the Miami Heat. Tucker played a pivotal role in guarding the opposing best player, often doing a decent job after switching onto the likes of Kevin Durant and Devin Booker in their finals run. While Jrue Holiday and Giannis are great defenders, the lack of a suitable replacement for a player in Tucker's role could lead to them exerting themselves more on the defensive end come playoffs.

The Hawks have started bursting through the ceilings of the heights they were touted to reach. Reaching the ECF milestone in Trae Young's third NBA season and showing no signs of slowing down, the Hawks are raring to go at the new NBA season. They have made the right moves to put themselves in position to replicate recent success by locking down Trae Young and John Collins to long term deals. The Hawks were a top 10 offense last regular season and ranked top 5 in advanced effiency metrics (eFG%, TS%) as a team.
